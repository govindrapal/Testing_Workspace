module 2:
1.
error 
defect
bug
failure : inability of system or component to 
perform required function within specifed requirements

2.
types of errors:

c control flow error
c calculation errr
H hardawre error 
I initial or later state 
R race condition 
E errors in handling
U user interface error
S state version and id control
E errors in handling or interpreting data
L load condition
T testing error

3.
Quality:
bug free 
delivered on time 
and within budget
system or component એમાં
specified customer requirements and expectaion,
needs meet thavi જોઈએ

aspects of quality : (GGG CD VR)
good design
good funationality
good sales after service
consistency
durable 
value for money
reliable 

4.
Risk
A factor that could result in future negative 
consequences.

5. wbo does testing?
software developer
software tester
end user
project lead/manager

what do tester?
test planing
test design
test execution
test environment management
test data management

Exit criteria:
out of time
out of budget

all defect have been fixed
when out exit criteria has been met


QA :
subset of STLC.
preventive activities 
process oriented activities.
focus on process and procedure

QC :
subset of QA
corrective process
product oriented activities.
focus on actual software testing, indentifying bug through implemntation of process and procedures.

Testing :
subset of QC
preventive process.
product oriented activities.
focus on actual testing of software

6.
testing vs debugging

7.
test scenarion:
what to be tested?
A scenario is any functionality that can be tested.
it is called as test condition or test possibility

test case :
how to be tested?
test case involve the set of steps, conditions and input which can be used 
while we performing the testing task 

8.
traceability matrix:
software id developed as per the client requirenents.
ensure that no one functionality missed.
if we should make any changes we can easily find 
which test cases need to update.

types:
1. forward traceability: mapping of requirements to test cases
2. backword traceability
3. bi-directional traceability

9.
STLC (software testing life cycle):
1. requirement analysis:
requurement નું analysis કરે 
testable requirements હોય એને identify કરે 
identify types of test to be performed
prepare RTM
if automation required.

deliver:
RTM
automation feasibility report 

2. test planning:
preparation test plan/strategy for different kind of testing.
test tool selection
test effort estimation
resource planning, roles and responsibilities

delivered:
test plan/strategy document
effort estimation document

3. test case design:
create test cases or test script
create test data

delivered:
test cases/ script
test data

4. test environment setup:


5. test execution:

6. test cycle closure:
